# Data Architect Brief

## Key Decisions
- Canonical chart of accounts with required categories.
- Store raw uploads and parsed actuals for auditability.

## Risks
- Mapping errors → enforce validation and review steps.

## Deliverables
- MVP: canonical schema + mapping table.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All actuals map to canonical categories before KPI calculations.
